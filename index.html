        <p><em>"There are three things, after all, that a poem must reach:
          the eye, the ear, and what we may call the heart or the mind. 
          It is most important of all to reach the heart of the
          reader."</em></p>

        
        <p><em>"Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings:
          it takes its origin from emotion recollected in
          tranquility."</em></p>

          <h2>Emotions and Poetry</h2>
            <p>Feelings are often hard to put into words and once
              they are words, those receiving them can process those
              feelings within themselves. Poetry is a connection 
              between the mind and outpouring of the author and a 
              willing reader. Poetry holds the key to something
              that seems so inexpressible. When a poet puts his 
              pen to the paper, he seeks to capture the eye, inviting 
              the ear to hear, and reaching out to the mind to feel and
              understand the depths of pain or heights of joy the poet
              is in.</p>

          <h2>The Crafting of Poetry Through Recollective Tranquility</h2>
            <p>Poetry indeed does originate from recollective tranquility.
              An example is in the poem, “Bells For John Whiteside's Daughter”.
              It seems so difficult to get anything out of this poem. But with
              a closer examination into the title, it is clear that there are
              two reasons for bells to someone, and those being death or marriage.
              Understanding this, the poem completely transfigures into a new 
              literary masterpiece. John Crowe Ransom manifests the overwhelming 
              feelings of loss of a loved one as he writes, 
              “But now go the bells, and we are ready,
              In one house we are sternly stopped
              To say we are vexed at her brown study,
              Lying so primly propped.” 
              Understanding this poem for me has brought back wave after wave 
              of emotion as I think of the great losses my family has suffered 
              as a result of death. It is difficult to explain the feeling of 
              standing before a casket containing a body that only a few days 
              before was filled with life. The way John Crowe expresses this 
              impacts readers. Those who are fortunate enough to have not 
              suffered such losses can sympathize with Crowe in the anguish 
              he describes.
              Poetry has reached the minds of many peoples regardless of background.
              As it grows to be ever more apparent, it exponentially grows deeper 
              into philosophies, ideas, and emotions. This is illustrated through 
              the now infamous poem, “The New Colossus”. Poems like this go much 
              deeper than the vast expanse of change between the ancient and the
              modern, the old and the new, what was and what now is. They go beyond 
              that of mere words that may be taken with a light heart. Poetry often 
              weighs and unexpectedly convicts an ataraxic mind. Versatile is a substantial
              way to describe it as it can be used to express love or cry out in protest.

          <h2><i>The Mighty Impact of Poetry</i></h2>
            <p>That said, poetry has truly shaped society through the spontaneity of 
              powerful words and ideas. What seemed unattainable years ago has become 
              a reality today. Rockets, planes, lunar landings, all have changed life 
              as we know it. One thing, however, that will not or cannot change, is 
              the integrity of great poems. They have changed society by encouraging 
              thinkers to think farther, to look beyond the state of the world, and 
              express it into a few seemingly simple lines.
